# About
The project is about [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), or simply thinking machines capable of carrying out any cognitive tasks.  

Started in 2012 from scratch during my free time in high school.  

The R&D process took 2 years.  
After countless refinement and mental test drive, the design is finally complete.  
A fully self enriching AI model, designed to be capable of learning and experience life just like people.

After that the coding started, mainly to test out the idea and feasibility in real life.  
Following its initial release on github in 2016.

## Goal
General automation of everything and frees up people's mind.

# Current Status
Seeking help to optimize and reduce code dependencies in order to make the system functional.
Funding is much appreciated.
