No setup required, you can simulate how decision is made by the system through your mind.

To demostrate that using only few simple constrains and steps, any action can be covered.

# Mental Simulation
Illustration of how similar it is against your own brain's daily thinking process.
Use your imagination and bear with me, keep your mind empty when following the steps to understand the process better.

Imagine you are now a newborn infant.
Your mind is empty.
The moment you begin to be aware of your own existence is when data starting to come in.

Light, scent, touches.
You store them in your memory.

All of those things doesn't make sense at all as none of them are related, yet.

You group them into a logical reference-able unit, and do nothing about it (Classification).
As you don't know what you can do to it at all.

The moment you opened your eyes, you discovered that there are actually mechanisms that you can control (output).

You associate that with previous experiences, and try to make sense out of it. (Global Changes Association)
Sense means how are they related.

You do so by repeating the process (Imitation).
Then get the difference between your actions.

If it goes out the way as before, you have successfully learned how to control it.
If it doesn't, you just learnt another variation of it.

You are interested in those variation (curiostiy).
You will constantly try to replicate those variation.
And that is the motive behind all the actions.

Nature also gave you your instinct. (Inclination, )
If things get to extreme, you will be inclined to get it down to normal level.
If things got too boring, you will try unique things to get fun.

So when you run out things to replicate, you will create new unique things on your own by mixing patterns.
That creates variation and creativity.

If the weather is hot, you will feel frustated (global distribution)
Frustation affects all of your actions.




How come all these related to the project?

-Memory structures are seldom mentioned as it is abstract, and it is always optimized and done instinctively thus we
don't give much attention to it in real life.
But if you simulate using the given (Memory Structure) model we discussed, it can perfectly represent all the mechanism required to formulate cognitive movement and storage.
It haven't be proven to be exact 100% replica of how brain works internally, but if it can carry out all the actions that we can observe and tell, does it still matteR?
