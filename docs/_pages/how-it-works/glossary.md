# Poly Value
Or simply polyVal is a system wide interchange-able value which have the range of 0~100 double.

# Global Distribution
Type of polyVal, to record the global incentive of the system at the moment.  
Calculated by accumulating all actions and inputs polyval at the moment and average it.

# Depth
Operation Depth, nested experiences depth.  
Each nested set of solution increase depth by 1.  
Used to record how abstract an action is (the more depth, the more abstract as one node is used to represent all the underlying complexity).
