*"General Purpose Learning Machines was thought to be theoretical impossible until now..."*  
_Featuring **ISRA** protocol, an experimental **Artificial General Intelligence architecture**_

# Design
The system is capable of representing any kind of logic, reason, experiences, sensory input, basically any possible combination of thought one's mind can generate in a simple unified generic memory structure.

It learns by unsupervised trail and errors in real setting, gaining experiences through imitation and repetition, and improve decisions accordingly.

# Overview
Quick overview of all the main operations and how they relates to each other (12sec):

## Video doesn't cover:
* How decision is made in depth.
* How the system make predictions, learn from failure and maintain learning potentials (fitness function).
* Algorithm used for pattern matching.
* Internal experience based memory structure generation and management.

# Participate
The project prototype already exist in [github]({{ site.githuburl }}), but due to current lack of development fund and aids, the code is not optimized and only support a few hardcoded hardware.  
Therefore real time demo footage is not yet available.
